                    <p>I started coding during night shifts in the hospital laboratory where I worked as a <a class="link dark-purple" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/medical-technologist-career-profile-1736165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medical Technologist</a>. A year later I entered an accelerated Computer Science postbac program at <a class="link dark-purple" href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Portland State University</a>, where I later graduated with a Masters of Computer Science. During my Masters I developed a love for functional programming and completed two specialization tracks (<i>Databases</i> and <i>Languages and Programming</i>), two internships, and a TA position (for the <i>Full Stack Web Development</i> and <i>Front End Web Technologies</i> courses).</p> 
                        <p>In practice, I'm a full stack developer who enjoys trying out new techniques and improving the efficiency, stability, and safety of existing code. I'm familiar with the theoretical and practical side of several programming paradigms, which allows me to identify alternative solutions to problems depending on how much factors like efficiency and stability should be prioritized.</p>
                        <p class="last">When I'm not coding I enjoy vegan cooking (my recipe blog is found <a class="link dark-purple" href="https://icookthings.surge.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>), adding books to my ever-growing 'to-read' pile, and playing with my two cats. I have an abiding love of fantasy games and let out my creativity by programming my own old-school rougelikes and running a Dungeons and Dragons game.</p>

                        <p>The Shadow Over Darkmoor is a text based roguelike game featuring over 100 locations to explore, maps, over 40 unique items to find, and over 30 enemy types. Darkmoor is written entirely in Clojure, a modern Lisp dialect, using functional programming.</p>
                        <p>I taught myself both Clojure and functional programming for this project because I wanted to experiment with using immutability and persistent data structures to avoid the state bugs and difficulty of updating I'd encountered while writing a similar game in C++. Of course writing a game, which is virtually nothing but side effects and state changes, in a paradigm that shuns both those things was difficult so early into my coding career!</p>
                        <p>A year later I completely revamped Darkmoor to include more functionality, smoother programming design choices, improved UI, containerized data structures, enemy stat scaling, and much more. To date Darkmoor remains the only project I've had the opportunity to redo.</p>

This course was taught by one of Curry's designers, Sergio Antoy, who delved quite deeply into the theory behind the language features in Curry as well as its evaluation strategies and compilation. Much of the course focused on mastering the principals of nondeterminism, residuation, and narrowing, which are core features of Curry. Constriant programming was used to gradually reduce the scope of compilation during runtime due the ineffeciencies of pure nondeterministic programming.</p>
                        <p>This was one of the most rewarding courses I took during my Masters and Curry has become one of my favorite languages to work in due to its simplicity and power. I found constraint programming very engaging, and I'm excited to apply those principals to other areas. I also became comfortable with a more Haskell-like style of functional programming, as most of my prior experience in that area had been from Lisps.</p>

                        <p>Graveyard is a Halloween version of the game <a class="link dark-purple" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Banqi</a>, originally designed by <a class="link dark-purple" href="https://github.com/thea-leake/graveyard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Thea Leake</a>. The point of the game is to be the last player that can make a valid move, which can be done by either eliminating or trapping the other player's pieces. Thea's implementation of the game required both players to play at the same computer, so I decided to design and implement a networking protocol to add remote gaming to Graveyard.</p>

                        <p>Concurrency is inherent to Graveyard's design. To ensure safety, Thea chose to write Graveyard using Racket, a functional language that minimizes state changes and side effects. Though I was not familiar with concurrency before this project, I decided to utilize concurrent channels and message passing in both the client and the server code.</p>
                        <p>At a high level, the protocol relies on collecting the starting and ending coordinates of each valid move from one player and sending it to the other player. The server is responsible for game creation and management, ensuring clients are still connected, and validating and passing on client messages. Clients are responsible for ensuring only valid moves are sent to the server, and in enacting moves received from the server. Click the link below to view the RFC for more details.</p>

                        <p>In this technical report, myself and four other students present our research into race and gender biases in machine learning algorithms used in natural language processing, facial recognition systems, criminal justice software, and medical software. All of the algorithms we researched were rife with bias and inequality, with causes ranging from biased training datasets or design choices to a neglect to research the scientific backing of certain aspects of the algorithm before development. Consequences include the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, an increased chance of targeted violence, unequitable crime sentancing, and the denial of medical care to women and racial, ethnic, and gender minorities.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, fixing the bias inherent in these systems is not an easy task for a variety of reasons. The lack of scientific backing during development, proprietary algorithms, general lack of awareness, or the support of these systems within certain industries all play a part.</p>

                        <p>This paper began as an experiment for PSU's Code Reading and Review course to see if I found typed Lisps easier to read than untyped Lisps. Many typed Lisps use the Hindley-Milner typing system, which I was biased against due to the dislike of Haskell I had at that time. In an effort to debias myself I spoke with one of the designers of Haskell, Mark Jones, about the rationale behind the inclusion of the Hindley-Milner typing system as one of the core features of Haskell. When Mark informed me that the Hindley-Milner typing system was partly inspired by Lisp, I decided to make that relationship the focus of my research instead.</p>
                        <p>In summary: Lisp pioneered dynamic typing, as static typing could not support the flexibility inherent to Lisp. Dynamic typing, however, comes with certain drawbacks—namely that typing errors are often not found before runtime and can instead crop up as "rather inscrutable bugs", as Henry Milner put it. These frustrations led to efforts to develop a typing system that supported flexible programming, but would be strict enough to avoid runtime type errors. That effort eventually culminated in the Hindley-Milner typing system, which was first described by Roger Hindley and later rediscovered by Milner.</p>
                        <p>Instead of introducing this typing system to Lisp, Milner built a new language around it. This language was ML, which has spawned several popular programming languages used today such as Haskell and Ocaml. It was only after several decades that the popularity of these languages lead to the creation of a popular typed Lisp: typed Racket.</p>

The schema design, implementation, and data entry were all done by myself. D&#38;D spells are elaborately interconnected to other areas of the game, which made defining the relations of the data and designing the schema a challenge. This was the first project I completed during my Masters program, and I learned a lot about importance of having the proper scope and realistic goals for a project.</p>
                        <p>Viewed in isolation, the database schema is overly complicated. I wanted the design to support the addition of non-spell data, but this split my focus and I failed to notice certain patterns in the design of the spells that would have simplified the schema I used. As a result, certain queries became longer and more cumbersome to write than they otherwise needed to be. In practice, however, this effect could be largely mitigated with the addition of a user interface (such as a search form or an API) to streamline query creation.</p>
